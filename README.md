This is my first repository, so I guess this will have a GPL license, dunno how though, hope I don't violate any copyrights..

I started with project over a year ago, and followed much of the default jnetpcap guide, and now I've begun coding on my own, pretty fun :)
The code is commented with the associated chapter in the jnetpcap guide.

Right now, I just need to make the org.Jnetpcap.PcapDumper work again to write packets caught in monitor mode to a file.
Besides that, I guess I'll make a way to replay the files, when the data makes sense.
Besides that, I think I'll look into ARP spoofing

Who knows, I might end up coding some for arpON xD

Make the force be with you
